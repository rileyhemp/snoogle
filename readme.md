# Snoogle v0.1

A better way to search Reddit.

## What's it do?

Whenever I want impartial and generally good information, I'll search for whatever I'm looking for followed by site:reddit.com.
This basically does that for me, with a few added benifits.

## Why not just use Reddit search?

It's terrible

## Why not just use Google?

Google is actually pretty bad at finding Reddit posts that have many replies. Snoogle takes the top 30 results (currently) and sorts them by comments. Then, it takes those results and displays them right in the app, so you don't have to go back and forth.

## Installation

Coming soon...
