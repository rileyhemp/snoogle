## Snoogle Search for Reddit

A better way to search Reddit.

### What's it do?

Ever add site:reddit.com to the end of your google searches?
This basically does that, with a few added benefits.

### Why not just use Reddit search?

It's terrible

### Why not just use Google?

Google is actually pretty bad at finding Reddit posts that have many replies. Snoogle takes the top 30 results (currently) and sorts them by comments. It also displays the results right in the app so you don't need to go back and forth between Google and your Reddit client. Snoogle currently only searches for self posts.

### Installation

Coming soon...
